# Chipotle
A WebScraper to scrape chipotle's public instagram for a code for free chipotle. This also uses Twilio to
text the code from a number of your choice from the number you set up on Twilio. A code is defined as
the first word in the caption that is all uppercase, between 5 and 14 characters (inclusive), and contains at least
one digit. If there are no "codes" in a caption, nothing is done (as it is assumed Chipotle hasn't posted the
free chipotle post). The definition of a code is based on general observation of what the free Chipotle codes
were during Chipotle's free Chipotle week in December 2019. This will check their instagram every second for an hour.
You will need to upgrade to a paid version of Twilio to get rid of
